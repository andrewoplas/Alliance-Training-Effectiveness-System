## Alliance Training Effectiveness System (ATES)

## Overview of Alliance
Alliance is an organization that truly cares about training and skills development. With so much effort devoted to training, the real question becomes evident: Did anyone really learn?

## Purpose
Bridge Program 2018 Project. This tool automates the confirmation needed by the training professional to measure the training effectiveness in every program delivered/implemented. The confirmation will impact the way we train by honing in the most effective training initiatives and taking a closer look at those initiatives that aren’t “measuring up.”

Creating assessment of an employee’s skill set and performance before and after a training moment. A simple example would be, testing a sales person’s current sales skills prior to training, then retesting the individual after the event to see the delta. There are so many improvements going on in this area right now because of data analytics, it’s a good one to jump on ahead of the curve.
